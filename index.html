  <h1>Privacy Policy for Quotiva</h1>
  <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> September 20, 2025</p>
  <p>Aaron Prasla (“we,” “our,” or “us”) built the Quotiva app as a business tool for creating quotations. This Privacy Policy explains how information is handled within the app.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>Quotiva does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or transmit any personal information to our servers or third parties. All data entered into the app — including but not limited to names, phone numbers, emails, addresses, quotes, GST numbers, and PST numbers — remains stored <strong>locally on the user’s device</strong>. We do not have access to this information.</p>

  <h2>2. Permissions</h2>
  <p>Quotiva does not request or use any device permissions such as camera, contacts, storage, or location. The app functions entirely offline.</p>

  <h2>3. User Control</h2>
  <p>Users have full control over their data stored within the app. They can add, edit, and delete their information at any time. Quotiva does not offer export or cloud backup features; all data stays on the device where it was created.</p>

  <h2>4. Third Parties</h2>
  <p>Quotiva does not use third-party analytics, crash reporters, advertising services, or external APIs. No user data is shared with third parties.</p>

  <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>Quotiva is designed primarily for business use but may be used by individuals of any age. Since the app does not collect any personal information, it complies with children’s privacy laws such as COPPA. Parents or guardians should supervise minors using the app as appropriate.</p>

  <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
  <p>Because all data is stored locally on the user’s device, the security of the information depends on the security of the device itself. We recommend enabling device-level security features such as passcodes or encryption.</p>

  <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will provide notice of changes within the app itself. Continued use of Quotiva after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

  <h2>8. Governing Law</h2>
  <p>This Privacy Policy and any disputes relating to it are governed by the laws of Canada and, where applicable, the laws of the United States.</p>

  <h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
